## Task Detail
</summary>
## Using the API endpoint

GET ​http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
GET ​http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
GET ​http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

Create a simple React Native app with two screens:

## Screen1:

A screen containing a list of posts, each cell displaying the title of the post. Tapping a cell should take you to Screen2.

## Screen2:

The detail screen for the selected post
● Back button should take you back to screen 1
● Post title
● Post body
● Post username
● Post comments (cells with their names and bodies)
Please do not focus on the UI, the focus of this exercise should be the quality of the code. The use of any 3rd party library is permitted.
The solution can be submitted via a zip archive or as a GIT repo (preferred solution).
